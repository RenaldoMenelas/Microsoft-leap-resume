I am a Frontend developer that enjoys solving problems and learning new technologies. My experience with self teaching myself hobbies has transfered over and helped me develop the skills needed to be driven, passionate and determined in continuing what I now can say is a hobbie and profession. I enjoy collaborating with others in a team environment and am thrilled whenever I am starting a new project.
